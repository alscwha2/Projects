# LeetCode

Code for all of my LeetCode solutions.
I mostly solve problems in Python, but I solved some in Java and JS as well.

I generally store my solutions in a file called 's.py' ('s' for solution).
I will often attempt a problem multiple times, either improving on the original solution, or attempting a different approach.
