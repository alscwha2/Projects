/**
 * The RequestHandler Class, part of the lego client-server project. It deals with the majority of the logic for manufacturing and shipping sets to the client.
 *
 * An instance of this class is created when a new request comes in to the server from the client. The instance is fed the request object, DBManager object,
 * Threadpool object(for constructing missing parts, explained later), a DBLockManager object for the DataBase, and a PrintWriter object to contact the client
 * with the results. The RequestHandler instance is then put into its own thread and executed. it first determines whether there is sufficient quantity of the
 * requested sets, then reserves (decrements) those sets so that no other thread can ship them. If the amount in the DB was not sufficient, it informs the client
 * that the sets are backordered, and the manufacturing process begins.
 *
 * MANUFACTURING SETS:
 * It checks if there are enough parts in the DataBase to manufacture more. If There are enough parts, the parts are decremented in the DB and sets incremented, then decremented
 * again when the sets are shipped to the client. If there are not enough parts, the part manufacturing begins.
 *
 * MANUFACTURING PARTS:
 * The parts and amounts needed are determined, and the parts which are in stock are "reserved" (decremented) for later set manufacture. Once all parts are
 * manufactured (by setting timer threads for 100 ms per INCREMENT_PARTS_BY parts), the part count in the
 * DB are incremented by a multiple of INCREMENT_PARTS_BY, decremented by the amount of sets ordered, sets are incremented by the appropriate amount, sets are
 * decremented by the appropriate amount, then the client is informed that the parts have been shipped.
