1 - do the math
	n/2+1 different combinations of 1 and 2 steps
	for each of those, place the smaller one in the gaps between the bigger one
		that is a combination problem, i.e. how many ways are there to seat all of
		these kind of steps in the gaps between this other kind of steps

2 - recursion: p(i) is the set of all possible paths for i
	p(i)=
		get p(i-1)
		iterate through 
			iterate through
				place stair in every possible gap
				anywhere where there is one stair
					turn it to double
					add to set
